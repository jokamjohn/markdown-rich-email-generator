Decided: Bi-weekly-ish.

# The results are in! 

In case you don't remember, in the last email I asked to give me some feedback. *How often would you like to receive a collection email containing links to everything I've written since the last letter?*

About two thirds of you asked for a weekly letter, and over a third asked for biweekly. **Thank you all so much for responding!** I had quite a few great conversations sparked from folks' emails.

In order to give myself an easier schedule and make sure there's enough content to fill every email, I'm going to start with biweekly and see how we like it. It's already been three weeks since the last email, so we'll get into our new rhythm next time around.

# What else is new?

The [Three-Minute Geek Show](http://threeminutegeekshow.com/) launched. The [Tighten Blog](http://blog.tighten.co/) launched. I switched to recording The Five-Minute Geek Show once a week instead of twice a week (temporarily). My book (the print edition) became available for [pre-order on Amazon](http://amzn.to/1o4IQRK)!

I spoke at [Sunshine PHP](http://2016.sunshinephp.com/) and I'll be speaking next week at [Nomad PHP](https://nomadphp.com/2015/11/20/2016-02-us/).
