# Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter!
I blog, podcast, and speak a lot, and share links here about everything I've done lately and will be doing soon.

But more importantly, I'll be sharing thoughts here that I don't have any space for elsewhere&mdash;about business and our real lives and about how you can do whatever it is that you do the best it can be done.

And as always, please let me know&mdash;what else do you want to read and hear about?

[June 15, 2015 - The Thin Line Between Confidence and Pride](https://send.mattstauffer.co/w/h73dP0BmIq8eIEEATkWf1A)

Note that I send out emails more frequently with a recap of content I've written elsewhere, but I'll also send out long-form content like those above every few months.
