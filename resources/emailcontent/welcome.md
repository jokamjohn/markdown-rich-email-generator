# Thanks for subscribing to my newsletter!
I'll be sharing my thoughts and advice on how to be an excellent developer, designer, or project manager. I write and podcast about code, but this newsletter will be more about how to be good--to others, to yourself, to your career, to your family and friends. How to do--whatever it is you do--well.

And as always, please let me know--what else do you want to read and hear about?
