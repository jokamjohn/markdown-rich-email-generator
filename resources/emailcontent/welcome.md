# Welcome, friend!
You're now subscribed to my newsletter. Between blog posts, guest posts, podcasts, and conference talks, I create a lot of content, and I want provide a place where you can get access to it all, together in one place.

As always, you can expect content about web development (frontend, backend, PHP, Javascript, CSS), entrepreneurship (startups, SaaSes), and more--coffee, how to be nice, running a software consultancy, cat gifs.

And as always, please let me know--what else do you want to read and hear about?
