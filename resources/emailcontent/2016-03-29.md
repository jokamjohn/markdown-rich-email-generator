# OK, that was more than two weeks.

Life is busy! All good stuff, thankfully. We're moving, my book is almost done, I'm speaking at [Peers Conf](http://peersconf.com/) in a few weeks, and work is busy as usual.

# What else is new?

My app [Pulled Over](https://pulledover.us/) was featured on the Twilio Blog: [The App That Shouldn't Exist: Pulled Over](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/03/the-app-that-shouldnt-exist-pulled-over.html)! I was very honored to have this wonderful article written about this project.

My book Laravel: Up And Running is now available for Ebook pre-order, which includes early access to the first six chapters! [Pre-order Laravel: Up and Running on Ebook here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044116.do)
